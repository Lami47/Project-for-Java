in the terminal run "Java HelloWorld.java"

it should open up the java app that i made

you can either create an account which will save your email and password locally(there are no requirements set for email or password so 1 letter will do)

or 
login via:
Liam Rosenberg
email: z
password: z

o
email: o
password: o

This app can currently:
1 - display the basics of the user
2 - allow the user to borrow books
3 - view books they currently have (due to my lack of knowledge when creating this app, it resets after closing the program)
4 - allows you to return books you've borrowed
5 - logout of the current account

in future you can expect: 
a popout display 
more user friendly experience
definitely a better system to store ALL the data
